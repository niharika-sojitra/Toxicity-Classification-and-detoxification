# Toxicity-Classification-and-detoxification

This is a final research project work for the course "COMP-5800 Project" in M.Sc. Computer Science, Lakehead University. Under Guidance of Dr. Vijay Mago. a project on the topic, "Toxicity : detection, classification and reduction".

**Abstract**

'Due to the increasing popularity of social media platforms these days, there has been a significant increase in the use of online communication channels, resulting in a vast amount of text data where individuals express their opinions on various subjects. However, this has also led to a rise in online abuse and harassment threats, which has become a significant issue to solve with the help of Natural Language Processing. In this research, we aim is to detect, categorize, and convert such comments into neutral or non-toxic ones by using various machine learning and neural network models along with pre-trained language models. In terms of detection and classification, DistillBERT achieved the highest accuracy rate of 94.34\%, while our proposed t5-paraDetox showed the best results for detoxification. Additionally, publicly available API has also been created that can convert toxic comments into their civil version.'
